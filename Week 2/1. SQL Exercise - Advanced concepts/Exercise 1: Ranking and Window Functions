1. Using ROW_NUMBER():
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ProductID,
        ProductName,
        Category,
        Price,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC) AS RowNum
    FROM Products
) AS RankedProducts
WHERE RowNum <= 3;

2. Using RANK():
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ProductID,
        ProductName,
        Category,
        Price,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC) AS RankVal
    FROM Products
) AS RankedProducts
WHERE RankVal <= 3;
3. Using DENSE_RANK():
SELECT *
FROM (
    SELECT 
        ProductID,
        ProductName,
        Category,
        Price,
        DENSE_RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY Category ORDER BY Price DESC) AS DenseRankVal
    FROM Products
) AS RankedProducts
WHERE DenseRankVal <= 3;
