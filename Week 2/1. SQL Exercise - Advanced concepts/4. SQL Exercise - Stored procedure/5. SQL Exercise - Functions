CREATE FUNCTION fn_CalculateAnnualSalary (@EmployeeID INT)
RETURNS DECIMAL(10, 2)
AS
BEGIN
    DECLARE @AnnualSalary DECIMAL(10, 2);

    -- Fetch the salary of the employee and multiply by 12 for the annual salary
    SELECT @AnnualSalary = Salary * 12
    FROM Employees
    WHERE EmployeeID = @EmployeeID;

    RETURN @AnnualSalary;
END;
